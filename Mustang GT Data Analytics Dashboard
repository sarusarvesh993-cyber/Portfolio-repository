1️⃣ Project Overview

The Mustang GT Data Analytics Dashboard is a full-stack analytics case study designed to showcase how data engineering, BI development, and business analytics come together to uncover insights in the automotive industry.

This project analyzes Mustang GT sales, customer behavior, regional trends, and vehicle variant performance.
The final Power BI dashboard helps answer business questions such as:

Which Mustang GT variants generate the most revenue?

Which regions or dealers perform best?

What trends appear across months and years?

How do customer segments influence sales?

This project demonstrates end-to-end analytics skills—from cleaning raw data to writing SQL, using Snowflake as a warehouse, and building an interactive dashboard in Power BI.

2️⃣ Problem Statement & Objective

Automotive companies often struggle to understand how different car models perform across regions, customer types, and time periods. Without clear insights, optimizing production, marketing, and inventory becomes challenging.

Objectives

This dashboard aims to answer:

How are Mustang GT sales distributed across regions?

Which variants generate the highest profit and demand?

What customer segments prefer Mustang GT models?

How do sales fluctuate over months/years?

Which dealers contribute the most units sold?

SELECT 
    Region,
    SUM(Units_Sold) AS Units_Sold,
    SUM(Sales) AS Revenue
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY Region;

3. Variant Comparison Query
SELECT 
    Variant,
    AVG(Engine_HP) AS Avg_HP,
    AVG(Sales) AS Avg_Sales
FROM car_specs
GROUP BY Variant;
