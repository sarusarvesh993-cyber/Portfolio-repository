# Revenue Pulse – Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

A Power BI case study by K. Sarvesh

---

## 📊 Project Overview

**Revenue Pulse** is a 2-page Power BI dashboard built to analyze sales performance, profitability, and customer insights for a mid-size retail business.  
It demonstrates end-to-end Data Analytics and Power BI skills including data modeling, DAX calculations, time-intelligence, KPI design, interactive storytelling, and practical business problem-solving.

This project is designed to showcase capabilities for Data Analyst / BI Analyst roles and is suitable for a fresher competing with 1–2 years of experience.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

The dashboard answers the following business questions:
- How are Revenue, Profit, and Growth (MoM & YoY) performing?
- Which regions, products, and customers drive the most value?
- How do sales reps compare in performance?
- Which product categories are high-revenue but low-margin?
- How do customer segments behave across loyalty and age groups?
- What is the near-term revenue forecast?

This simulates a real-company scenario to support strategic decision-making.

## 🧱 Dataset & Data Model

The project uses a clean, relational star-schema model.

Fact table
- Sales_Fact (500–700 rows)
  - Date — Transaction date
  - ProductID — FK → Products_Dim
  - CustomerID — FK → Customers_Dim
  - SalesRepID — FK → SalesRep_Dim
  - Region — Sales region
  - UnitsSold — Quantity
  - UnitPrice — Price per unit
  - Revenue — UnitsSold × UnitPrice
  - Cost — Expense tied to sale
  - Profit — Revenue − Cost

Dimension tables
- Products_Dim
  - ProductName, Category, Subcategory, Brand, LaunchYear
- Customers_Dim
  - Segment (Retail / SMB / Enterprise), AgeGroup, LoyaltyLevel (Bronze → Platinum), JoinDate
- SalesRep_Dim
  - Region, ExperienceLevel (Junior / Mid / Senior), JoinYear
- Calendar_Dim
  - Date, Year, MonthNumber, MonthName, Quarter, YearMonth

Notes:
- The model follows a star schema with Sales_Fact at the center and dimension lookups for efficient reporting and time intelligence.

## 🧮 Key DAX Measures

Core KPIs used in the dashboard:

Total Revenue
```dax
Total Revenue = SUM(Sales_Fact[Revenue])
```

Total Profit
```dax
Total Profit = SUM(Sales_Fact[Profit])
```

Profit Margin %
```dax
Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Revenue])
```

Total Revenue LY (Last Year)
```dax
Total Revenue LY =
CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Calendar_Dim[Date]))
```

Total Revenue LM (Last Month)
```dax
Total Revenue LM =
CALCULATE([Total Revenue], DATEADD(Calendar_Dim[Date], -1, MONTH))
```

MoM Growth %
```dax
MoM Growth % =
DIVIDE([Total Revenue] - [Total Revenue LM], [Total Revenue LM])
```

YoY Growth %
```dax
YoY Growth % =
DIVIDE([Total Revenue] - [Total Revenue LY], [Total Revenue LY])
```

Sales Rep Performance Score
```dax
Sales Rep Performance Score =
VAR BaseRevenue = CALCULATE([Total Revenue], ALL(SalesRep_Dim))
VAR BaseProfit  = CALCULATE([Total Profit], ALL(SalesRep_Dim))
VAR BaseMargin  = CALCULATE([Profit Margin %], ALL(SalesRep_Dim))
VAR RevenueScore = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], BaseRevenue) * 50
VAR ProfitScore  = DIVIDE([Total Profit], BaseProfit) * 30
VAR MarginScore  = DIVIDE([Profit Margin %], BaseMargin) * 20
RETURN RevenueScore + ProfitScore + MarginScore
```

Revenue 3M Moving Avg
```dax
Revenue 3M Moving Avg =
AVERAGEX(
    DATESINPERIOD(Calendar_Dim[Date], MAX(Calendar_Dim[Date]), -3, MONTH),
    [Total Revenue]
)
```

## 🚀 How to use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open Power BI Desktop and load the CSV files from the `Data/` folder (or refresh the PBIX dataset).
3. Open `PBIX/Revenue_Pulse_Dashboard.pbix` to explore the two pages.
4. Use slicers and drill-through to explore by Region, Product Category, Customer Segment, and SalesRep.
5. To publish, sign in to Power BI Service and publish the PBIX. Configure scheduled refresh if connecting to cloud storage or a data gateway.

Tips:
- Ensure Calendar_Dim[Date] is marked as a Date table in Power BI for full time-intelligence functionality.
- Validate relationships: Sales_Fact → Calendar_Dim (Date), Sales_Fact → Products_Dim (ProductID), etc.

## ✅ Validation & Notes

- The dataset in this case study is intentionally compact to focus on modeling and DAX examples.
- Replace sample CSVs with real/external data for production scenarios; the model and measures are designed to scale.
- Review row-level security and data governance before publishing to production.

---

## 🔭 Next steps / Improvements

- Add a forecasting model (e.g., exponential smoothing or Prophet) for longer-term forecasting.
- Include drill-through pages per Product and per Customer with deeper KPIs (LTV, churn risk).
- Implement row-level security for region-based access control.
- Automate data refresh via Power BI Gateway or cloud data pipelines.
- Add unit tests for DAX and automated data validation (e.g., using Power BI REST APIs or deployment pipelines).
